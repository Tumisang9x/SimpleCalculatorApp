# Simple Calculator with Test Driven Development (TDD)

This project demonstrates **Test Driven Development (TDD)** by implementing a simple calculator in **Java**. The goal is to build two functions:

- **`add`**: Starts by adding two integers and is then expanded to handle multiple integers.
- **`multiply`**: Follows a similar approach to handle both two integers and multiple integers.

The development process follows TDD principles, where tests are written first and the code is then implemented to pass those tests.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Add JUnit to your project dependencies**: Ensure that JUnit is included in your build tool (Maven or Gradle).

## Development Process

1. **Write unit tests for the `add` function**:
   - Handle both two integers and multiple integers.
   
2. **Write unit tests for the `multiply` function**:
   - Handle both two integers and multiple integers.

3. **Modify the functions** as necessary to ensure all tests pass.

4. **Run the tests** using Maven or Gradle to verify that both `add` and `multiply` behave as expected.

## Running Tests

Use Maven or Gradle to run the tests:

- **For Maven**:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

- **For Gradle**:

   ```bash
   gradle test
   ```

## Conclusion

This project is an example of using **TDD** to develop simple, testable functions. By writing tests first and modifying the code to pass them, the code is continuously validated to ensure correctness.
